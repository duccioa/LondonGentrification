<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s for Lunch? - Gentrification and Consumer Preference</strong></p>
<p>This project selects common words appearing in the names of food businesses in London, revealing fascinating spatial differences in what people from high and low income areas in London buy for lunch.</p>
<p>This website allows you to explore these patterns for yourself using the options on the interactive map to select different word tokens. What&rsquo;s for lunch where you live? Where does your area sit in the food gentrification classification?</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Gentrification: The term used to describe the phenomenon where many traditionally working class and industrial areas of the inner city are becoming dominated by middle class residents.</p>
<p>In addition to renovated flats, it is widely noted that areas that become gentrified experience a broad cultural shift. Retail and entertainment spaces change to suit consumer tastes. Boutique coffee shops replace standard fried food joints. These retailers are held up as symbols of gentrification, becoming the focus of social unrest caused by the pricing out of low-income residents, such as the infamous protest at the Shoreditch &lsquo;Cereal Killer Caf&eacute;&rsquo; in late 2015. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This project applied statistical and spatial analysis techniques to common word tokens found in the names of food businesses in London (Food Standards Agency Database). The resulting analysis reveals strong spatial segregation in consumer preferences for common food business types across high and low income areas. From these results a four category classification for London wards has been developed based on a clustering of significant variables.</p>
